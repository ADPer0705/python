I am thinking about making a chess game in python, to practice the language
initially it'll just be a two player game, playing while typing in the moves on the terminal,
then, I'll add the following two functionalities :
 - adding chess algorithms to make computer moves, then it'll be available to play with a single player
 - adding a gui, cause honestly, no one would play chess on a terminal 
The order might vary, or they development of the features may coincide 
lastly, I'll try and make it playable online on multiple devices
